# CS 262 Monopoly Webservice

This is the data service application for my [CS262 repo](https://github.com/sudonotdisturb/CS262) 
and it is deployed here:
          
<https://cs262-service.herokuapp.com/>

It is based on the standard Heroku with Node.js tutorial.

<https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs>  

The database is relational with the schema specified in the `sql/` sub-directory,
 and is hosted on [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/). The database user
and password are stored as Heroku configuration variables rather than in this (public) repo.
